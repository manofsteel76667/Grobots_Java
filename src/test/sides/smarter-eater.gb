Smarter Eater is a modified version of Simple Eater with sensors for finding
food.  It only wanders randomly when it detects no food.

Simple Eater is a modified version of Simple Mover which gets its energy by
eating instead of via solar cells.

(Simple Eater change log)
(20030717) Version 2 tweaks eating speed and energy storage to increase chances of
survival and adds armor while allowing up to 10 cells in the initial seed.

(20040208) Version 3 adds reproduction capabilities.
(20040211) Changed found-food "backing up" loop so that it will actually get
to the reproduction loop.  Can reproduce now but doesn't stop on food as well
and sometimes gets stuck along edges and in corners.
